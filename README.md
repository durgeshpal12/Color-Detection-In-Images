Sparks_foundation IOT and Computer Vision - Task 2 Color Identification In Images

Hello Everyone!! I am glad to share with you all that I have successfully completed project named 'COLOR DETECTION IN IMAGES' using python software I have used two main libraries here i.e opencV and pandas. opencV is used to load the image that is provided and pandas is used for the csv file. The csv file contains almost 800 colours and when we double click anywhere on the image, with the help of the csv file the program gives us the name of the closest matching colour.
